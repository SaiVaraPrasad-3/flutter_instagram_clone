Flutter is an SDK owned by Google to create applications for #AndroidandIOS using a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language (also owned by Google). Flutter was in alpha when I released this video, so things might still change a bit. But the SDK is already mature enough to write some cool apps!

* Go to the Firebase Console for your new instance.
* Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu
* Click the "sign-in method" tab
* Click "Google" and enable it


4. Enable the Firebase Database
* Go to the Firebase Console
* Click "Database" in the left-hand menu
* Click the Cloudstore "Create Database" button
* Select "Start in test mode" and "Enable"

5. (skip if not running on Android)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android,
* Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:

* In the Firebase console, in the settings of your Android app, add your SHA-1 key by clicking "Add Fingerprint".
* Follow instructions to download google-services.json
* place `google-services.json` into `/android/app/`.

6. (skip if not running on iOS)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for iOS, with your app package name
* Follow instructions to download GoogleService-Info.plist
* Open XCode, right click the Runner folder, select the "Add Files to 'Runner'" menu, and select the GoogleService-Info.plist file to add it to /ios/Runner in XCode
* Open /ios/Runner/Info.plist in a text editor. Locate the CFBundleURLSchemes key. The second item in the array value of this key is specific to the Firebase instance. Replace it with the value for REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist
